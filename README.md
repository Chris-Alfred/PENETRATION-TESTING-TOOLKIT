DESCRIPTION : 

This Python script is a basic penetration testing toolkit designed for educational and ethical hacking purposes. It includes three main functionalities: port scanning, banner grabbing, and brute-force login testing. The scan_ports function scans ports 1 to 100 on a user-specified IP address using socket connections to identify open ports. The grab_banner function then attempts to retrieve and display service banners from a selected port (default is port 80), which can reveal useful information about the target server. The script also includes a brute_force_login function that performs a login brute-force attack on a safe and legal test website (http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php). It uses a predefined username and a list of common passwords to attempt access and prints the correct password if successful. The script is interactive, asking the user for input to start scanning and confirm brute-forcing, and concludes with a reminder to use the tool ethically
